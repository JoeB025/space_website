    general_info: `The Milky Way is the galaxy that includes the Solar System, with the name describing the galaxy's appearance from Earth: a hazy band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be individually distinguished by the naked eye. The term Milky Way is a translation of the Latin via lactea, from the Greek γαλαξίας κύκλος (galaxías kýklos), meaning "milky circle". From Earth, the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within. Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610. Until the early 1920s, most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained all the stars in the Universe. Following the 1920 Great Debate between the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber Doust Curtis, observations by Edwin Hubble showed that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies.

    The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy with a D25 isophotal diameter estimated at 26.8 ± 1.1 kiloparsecs (87,400 ± 3,600 light-years), but only about 1,000 light-years thick at the spiral arms (more at the bulge). Recent simulations suggest that a dark matter area, also containing some visible stars, may extend up to a diameter of almost 2 million light-years. The Milky Way has several satellite galaxies and is part of the Local Group of galaxies, which form part of the Virgo Supercluster, which is itself a component of the Laniakea Supercluster.
    
    It is estimated to contain 100 to 400 billion stars and at least that number of planets. The Solar System is located at a radius of about 27,000 light-years from the Galactic Center, on the inner edge of the Orion Arm, one of the spiral-shaped concentrations of gas and dust. The stars in the innermost 10,000 light-years form a bulge and one or more bars that radiate from the bulge. The Galactic Center is an intense radio source known as Sagittarius A*, a supermassive black hole of 4.100 million solar masses. Stars and gases at a wide range of distances from the Galactic Center orbit at approximately 220 kilometers per second. The constant rotational speed appears to contradict the laws of Keplerian dynamics and suggests that much of the mass of the Milky Way is invisible to telescopes, neither emitting nor absorbing electromagnetic radiation. This conjectural mass has been termed "dark matter". The rotational period is about 212 million years at the radius of the Sun.
    
    The Milky Way as a whole is moving at a velocity of approximately 600 km per second with respect to extragalactic frames of reference. The oldest stars in the Milky Way are nearly as old as the Universe itself and thus probably formed shortly after the Dark Ages of the Big Bang.`,
    observation_history: `The Milky Way is visible as a hazy band of white light, some 30° wide, arching the night sky. Although all the individual naked-eye stars in the entire sky are part of the Milky Way Galaxy, the term "Milky Way" is limited to this band of light. The light originates from the accumulation of unresolved stars and other material located in the direction of the galactic plane. Brighter regions around the band appear as soft visual patches known as star clouds. The most conspicuous of these is the Large Sagittarius Star Cloud, a portion of the central bulge of the galaxy. Dark regions within the band, such as the Great Rift and the Coalsack, are areas where interstellar dust blocks light from distant stars. Peoples of the southern hemisphere, including the Inca and Australian aborigines, identified these regions as dark cloud constellations. The area of sky that the Milky Way obscures is called the Zone of Avoidance.

    The Milky Way has a relatively low surface brightness. Its visibility can be greatly reduced by background light, such as light pollution or moonlight. The sky needs to be darker than about 20.2 magnitude per square arcsecond in order for the Milky Way to be visible. It should be visible if the limiting magnitude is approximately +5.1 or better and shows a great deal of detail at +6.1. This makes the Milky Way difficult to see from brightly lit urban or suburban areas, but very prominent when viewed from rural areas when the Moon is below the horizon. Maps of artificial night sky brightness show that more than one-third of Earth's population cannot see the Milky Way from their homes due to light pollution.
    
    As viewed from Earth, the visible region of the Milky Way's galactic plane occupies an area of the sky that includes 30 constellations. The Galactic Center lies in the direction of Sagittarius, where the Milky Way is brightest. From Sagittarius, the hazy band of white light appears to pass around to the galactic anticenter in Auriga. The band then continues the rest of the way around the sky, back to Sagittarius, dividing the sky into two roughly equal hemispheres.
    
    The galactic plane is inclined by about 60° to the ecliptic (the plane of Earth's orbit). Relative to the celestial equator, it passes as far north as the constellation of Cassiopeia and as far south as the constellation of Crux, indicating the high inclination of Earth's equatorial plane and the plane of the ecliptic, relative to the galactic plane. The north galactic pole is situated at right ascension 12h 49m, declination +27.4° (B1950) near β Comae Berenices, and the south galactic pole is near α Sculptoris. Because of this high inclination, depending on the time of night and year, the Milky Way arch may appear relatively low or relatively high in the sky. For observers from latitudes approximately 65° north to 65° south, the Milky Way passes directly overhead twice a day.`,
    timeline: `1. 13.6 Billion Years Ago: The Milky Way forms from the gravitational collapse of a region within a giant molecular cloud. This marks the beginning of the galaxy's formation.

    2. 12 Billion Years Ago: The earliest population of stars begins to form in the Milky Way. These stars are primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with small traces of heavier elements.
    
    3. 6-8 Billion Years Ago: The Milky Way experiences a period of intense star formation, creating vast numbers of stars, including many of the oldest stars still present in the galaxy today.
    
    4. 4.6 Billion Years Ago: The Solar System, including the Sun and its planets, forms within the Milky Way from a molecular cloud and debris left over from previous generations of stars.
    
    5. 3-2 Billion Years Ago: The Milky Way continues to evolve, with ongoing star formation, stellar evolution, and interactions between stars and gas clouds shaping the galaxy's structure.
    
    6. 2 Billion Years Ago - Present: The Milky Way undergoes various phases of evolution, including the formation of its spiral arms, the merger of smaller satellite galaxies, and interactions with neighboring galaxies. The galaxy continues to evolve dynamically, with stars forming, dying, and being redistributed throughout its disk.
    
    7. Present Day: The Milky Way, as observed today, is a barred spiral galaxy with a complex structure consisting of a central bulge, spiral arms, and a disk containing stars, gas, and dust. It is part of the Local Group of galaxies, which also includes the Andromeda Galaxy and numerous smaller galaxies. The Milky Way continues to evolve, with ongoing research and observations shedding light on its past, present, and future.`,

    general_info: `The Andromeda Galaxy is a barred spiral galaxy and is the nearest major galaxy to the Milky Way. 
    It was originally named the Andromeda Nebula and is cataloged as Messier 31, M31, and NGC 224. Andromeda has a 
    diameter of about 46.56 kiloparsecs (152,000 light-years) and is approximately 765 kpc (2.5 million light-years) from Earth. 
    The galaxy's name stems from the area of Earth's sky in which it appears, the constellation of Andromeda, which 
    itself is named after the princess who was the wife of Perseus in Greek mythology. 

    The virial mass of the Andromeda Galaxy is of the same order of magnitude as that of the Milky Way, at 1 trillion 
    solar masses (2.0×10^42 kilograms). The mass of either galaxy is difficult to estimate with any accuracy, 
    but it was long thought that the Andromeda Galaxy was more massive than the Milky Way by a margin of some 25% to 50%. 
    This has been called into question by early 21st-century studies indicating a possibly lower mass for the Andromeda 
    Galaxy and a higher mass for the Milky Way. The Andromeda Galaxy has a diameter of about 46.56 kpc (152,000 ly), 
    making it the largest member of the Local Group of galaxies in terms of extension.
    
    The Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies are expected to collide in around 4 to 5 billion years, merging to potentially 
    form a giant elliptical galaxy or a large lenticular galaxy.
    
    With an apparent magnitude of 3.4, the Andromeda Galaxy is among the brightest of the Messier objects, 
    and is visible to the naked eye from Earth on moonless nights, even when viewed from areas with moderate light pollution.`,

    observation_history: `The Andromeda Galaxy is visible to the naked eye in dark skies. Around the year 964 CE, 
    the Persian astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi was the first to formally describe the Andromeda Galaxy. He 
    referred to it in his Book of Fixed Stars as a "nebulous smear" or "small cloud".

    Star charts of that period labeled it as the Little Cloud. In 1612, the German astronomer Simon Marius gave 
    an early description of the Andromeda Galaxy based on telescopic observations. Pierre Louis Maupertuis 
    conjectured in 1745 that the blurry spot was an island universe. In 1764, Charles Messier cataloged Andromeda 
    as object M31 and incorrectly credited Marius as the discoverer despite its being visible to the naked eye. 
    In 1785, the astronomer William Herschel noted a faint reddish hue in the core region of Andromeda. He believed 
    Andromeda to be the nearest of all the "great nebulae", and based on the color and magnitude of the nebula, he 
    incorrectly guessed that it was no more than 2,000 times the distance of Sirius, or roughly 18,000 ly (5.5 kpc).
    
    In 1850, William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse made the first drawing of Andromeda's spiral structure.
    
    In 1864, William Huggins noted that the spectrum of Andromeda differed from that of a gaseous nebula. The spectrum 
    of Andromeda displays a continuum of frequencies, superimposed with dark absorption lines that help identify the 
    chemical composition of an object. Andromeda's spectrum is very similar to the spectra of individual stars, and from 
    this, it was deduced that Andromeda has a stellar nature. In 1885, a supernova (known as S Andromedae) was seen in 
    Andromeda, the first and so far only one observed in that galaxy. At the time it was called "Nova 1885"—the difference 
    between "novae" in the modern sense and supernovae was not yet known. Andromeda was considered to be a nearby object, 
    and it was not realized that the "nova" was much brighter than ordinary novae.
    
    The earliest known photograph of the Great Andromeda "Nebula" (with M110 to the upper right), by Isaac Roberts 
    (29 December 1888). In 1888, Isaac Roberts took one of the first photographs of Andromeda, which was still commonly 
    thought to be a nebula within our galaxy. Roberts mistook Andromeda and similar "spiral nebulae" as star systems 
    being formed.
    
    In 1912, Vesto Slipher used spectroscopy to measure the radial velocity of Andromeda with respect to the Solar 
    System—the largest velocity yet measured, at 300 km/s (190 mi/s).`,
    timeline: `
    1. Formation (Around 10 Billion Years Ago): The Andromeda Galaxy, also known as M31, begins forming from the gravitational collapse of gas and dust in the early universe, likely around 10 billion years ago.
    
    2. Early Evolution (Around 9 Billion Years Ago): As gas and dust continue to accrete, the Andromeda Galaxy undergoes rapid star formation, leading to the formation of its central bulge and spiral arms.
    
    3. Maturity (Around 5 Billion Years Ago): By this time, the Andromeda Galaxy has reached a state of relative stability, with a mature population of stars and well-defined spiral structure. It continues to evolve through interactions with nearby galaxies and ongoing star formation.
    
    4. Interaction with Satellite Galaxies (Present Day - Past Few Billion Years): The Andromeda Galaxy interacts gravitationally with its satellite galaxies, such as M32 and M110. These interactions lead to tidal distortions, star formation, and the eventual accretion of satellite galaxies into the larger Andromeda system.
    
    5. Future Collision with the Milky Way (Future - 4 to 5 Billion Years): The Andromeda Galaxy is on a collision course with the Milky Way Galaxy. Computer simulations suggest that the two galaxies will collide in about 4 to 5 billion years, leading to the formation of a new, larger galaxy often referred to as "Milkomeda" or "Milkdromeda."
    
    6. Galactic Merger (Future - 6 to 7 Billion Years): Over the course of several billion years following the collision, the individual stars and gas clouds of the Milky Way and Andromeda will merge to form a single, larger galaxy. The merger will likely trigger intense star formation and reshape the morphology of the resulting galaxy.
    
    7. Final Outcome (Far Future): The final outcome of the Milky Way-Andromeda merger is uncertain and depends on various factors such as the galaxies' initial conditions, mass distribution, and the presence of dark matter. However, it is likely that the merged galaxy will settle into a new, stable configuration over many billions of years, continuing to evolve through interactions with other galaxies in the Local Group.

    general_info: `The Antennae Galaxies (also known as NGC 4038/NGC 4039 or Caldwell 60/Caldwell 61) are a pair of interacting galaxies in the constellation Corvus. They are currently going through a starburst phase, in which the collision of clouds of gas and dust, with entangled magnetic fields, causes rapid star formation. They were discovered by William Herschel in 1785. The Antennae Galaxies are undergoing a galactic collision. Located in the NGC 4038 group with five other galaxies, these two galaxies are known as the Antennae Galaxies because the two long tails of stars, gas and dust ejected from the galaxies as a result of the collision resemble an insect's antennae.

    The nuclei of the two galaxies are joining to become one giant galaxy. Most galaxies probably undergo at least one significant collision in their lifetimes. This is likely the future of our Milky Way when it collides with the Andromeda Galaxy. This collision and merger sequence (the Toomre sequence) for galaxy evolution was developed in part by successfully modeling the Antennae Galaxies' "antennae" in particular.
    
    Five supernovae have been discovered in NGC 4038: SN 1921A, SN 1974E, SN 2004GT, SN 2007sr and SN 2013dk.
    
    A recent study finds that these interacting galaxies are less remote from the Milky Way than previously thought—at 45 million light-years instead of 65 million light-years.
    
    They are located 0.25° north of 31 Crateris and 3.25° southwest of Gamma Corvi.
    
    The Antennae galaxies also contain a relatively young collection of massive globular clusters that were possibly formed as a result of the collision between the two galaxies. The young age of these clusters is in contrast to the average age of most known globular clusters (which are around 12 billion years old), with the formation of the globulars likely originating from shockwaves, generated by the collision of the galaxies, compressing large, massive molecular clouds. The densest regions of the collapsing and compressing clouds are believed to be the birthplace of the clusters.`,
    observation_history: `The Antennae galaxies, also known as NGC 4038 and NGC 4039, are a pair of interacting galaxies located in the constellation Corvus. Here's a fictional observation history for the Antennae galaxy:

    Observation History of the Antennae Galaxy:
    
    1. Discovery: The Antennae galaxies were first observed by the English astronomer William Herschel on February 7, 1785. Herschel noted their peculiar appearance and classified them as a pair of interacting galaxies.
    
    2. Early Studies: Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, astronomers continued to study the Antennae galaxies, noting their distorted shapes and prominent tidal tails. Observations suggested that the galaxies were in the process of merging.
    
    3. Modern Observations: With the advancement of telescopes and observational techniques, astronomers gained a deeper understanding of the Antennae galaxies. High-resolution images captured by space telescopes like the Hubble Space Telescope revealed intricate details of the merging process, including regions of intense star formation and massive star clusters.
    
    4. Starburst Activity: One of the most striking features of the Antennae galaxies is their intense starburst activity. The collision between the two galaxies triggered a surge in star formation, leading to the formation of thousands of new stars within massive star clusters.
    
    5. Tidal Deformations: Observations of the Antennae galaxies also revealed extensive tidal deformations caused by gravitational interactions between the two galaxies. These tidal tails, composed of stars, gas, and dust, extend for tens of thousands of light-years and provide valuable insights into the dynamics of galactic mergers.
    
    6. Ongoing Evolution: The Antennae galaxies continue to evolve as they merge and interact. Astronomers monitor the galaxies using ground-based telescopes and space observatories to track changes in their structure, star formation rates, and dynamics over time.
    
    7. Scientific Significance: The Antennae galaxies serve as an important laboratory for studying galaxy interactions and mergers, which play a crucial role in the evolution of galaxies. By observing the Antennae galaxies and similar systems, astronomers gain insights into the processes driving galactic evolution in the universe.`,
    timeline: `About 1.2 billion years ago, the Antennae were two separate galaxies. NGC 4038 was a barred spiral galaxy and NGC 4039 was a spiral galaxy. 900 million years ago, the Antennae began to approach one another, looking similar to NGC 2207 and IC 2163. 600 million years ago, the Antennae passed through each other, looking like the Mice Galaxies. 300 million years ago, the Antennae's stars began to be released from both galaxies. Today the two streamers of ejected stars extend far beyond the original galaxies, resulting in the antennae shape.

    Within 400 million years, the Antennae's nuclei will collide and become a single core with stars, gas, and dust around it. Observations and simulations of colliding galaxies (e.g., by Alar Toomre) suggest that the Antennae Galaxies will eventually form an elliptical galaxy.`

It also has an H II nucleus.",
    observation_history: "The Triangulum Galaxy was probably discovered by the Italian astronomer Giovanni Battista Hodierna before 1654. In his work De systemate orbis cometici; deque admirandis coeli caracteribus (\"About the systematics of the cometary orbit, and about the admirable objects of the sky\"), he listed it as a cloud-like nebulosity or obscuration and gave the cryptic description, \"near the Triangle hinc inde\". This is in reference to the constellation Triangulum as a pair of triangles. The magnitude of the object matches M33, so it is most likely a reference to the Triangulum Galaxy.\n\nThe galaxy was independently discovered by Charles Messier on the night of August 25–26, 1764. It was published in his Catalog of Nebulae and Star Clusters (1771) as object number 33; hence the name M33. When William Herschel compiled his extensive catalog of nebulae, he was careful not to include most of the objects identified by Messier. However, M33 was an exception, and he cataloged this object on September 11, 1784, as H V-17.\n\nHerschel also cataloged the Triangulum Galaxy's brightest and largest H II region (diffuse emission nebula containing ionized hydrogen) as H III.150 separately from the galaxy itself; the nebula eventually obtained NGC number 604. As seen from Earth, NGC 604 is located northeast of the galaxy's central core. It is one of the largest H II regions known, with a diameter of nearly 1500 light-years and a spectrum similar to that of the Orion Nebula. Herschel also noted three other smaller H II regions (NGC 588, 592, and 595).\n\nIt was among the first \"spiral nebulae\" identified as such by Lord Rosse in 1850. In 1922 to 1923, John Charles Duncan and Max Wolf discovered variable stars in the nebulae. Edwin Hubble showed in 1926 that 35 of these stars were classical Cepheids, thereby allowing him to estimate their distances. The results were consistent with the concept of spiral nebulae being independent galactic systems of gas and dust, rather than just nebulae in the Milky Way.",
