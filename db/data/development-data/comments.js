    body: `The moon controls the tides primarily through its gravitational pull on Earth's oceans. This gravitational force causes the water in the oceans to bulge outwards towards the moon, creating a high tide on the side of Earth facing the moon and on the opposite side, due to the centrifugal force created by Earth's rotation.

    As Earth rotates on its axis, locations on the planet experience two high tides and two low tides in roughly a 24-hour period. When the moon is directly overhead or on the opposite side of the Earth (at full moon and new moon), its gravitational force is strongest, causing higher high tides, known as spring tides. When the moon is at a right angle to the line between the Earth and the sun (at first quarter and third quarter), its gravitational force combines with that of the sun to produce lower high tides, known as neap tides.
    
    In summary, the gravitational pull of the moon, along with the centrifugal force due to Earth's rotation, creates the tidal bulges that result in the regular rise and fall of ocean levels, known as tides.`,
