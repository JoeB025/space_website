  {
      topic: 'Planet',
      description: 'A celestial body that orbits a star, is spherical in shape, and has cleared its orbit of other debris. Planets are not capable of sustaining nuclear fusion like stars.'
  },
  {
      topic: 'Black Hole',
      description: 'A region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. Black holes are formed when massive stars collapse under their own gravity.'
  },
  {
      topic: 'Solar System',
      description: 'A system comprising a star (such as the Sun) and all the objects that orbit it, including planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and meteoroids.'
  },
  {
      topic: 'Galaxy',
      description: 'A massive, gravitationally bound system consisting of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, dark matter, and various other astronomical objects.'
  },
  {
      topic: 'Star',
      description: 'A luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. Stars emit light and heat as a result of nuclear fusion reactions occurring in their cores.'
  },
  {
      topic: 'Asteroid',
      description: 'A small rocky body that orbits the Sun, primarily found in the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. They are remnants from the early formation of the Solar System.'
  },
  {
      topic: 'Comet',
      description: 'A small celestial body composed of ice, dust, and rocky material that orbits the Sun in an elliptical orbit. When close to the Sun, comets develop a visible coma and sometimes a tail.'
  },
  {
      topic: 'Dwarf Planet',
      description: 'A celestial body that orbits the Sun, has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a nearly round shape, but has not cleared its orbit of other debris.'
  },
  {
      topic: 'Neutron Star',
      description: 'A dense, compact stellar remnant composed almost entirely of neutrons. Neutron stars are formed from the remnants of supernova explosions.'
  },
  {
      topic: 'Supernova',
      description: 'An extremely energetic stellar explosion that occurs during the final evolutionary stages of massive stars. Supernovae can briefly outshine entire galaxies and release vast amounts of energy and heavy elements into space.'
  },
  {
      topic: 'Galactic Cluster',
      description: 'A gravitationally bound collection of hundreds to thousands of galaxies. Galactic clusters are the largest known gravitationally bound structures in the universe.'
  },
  {
      topic: 'Nebula',
      description: 'A cloud of gas and dust in space, either newly formed or the remnants of a supernova explosion. Nebulae serve as the birthplace for stars and planetary systems.'
  },
  {
      topic: 'Quasar',
      description: 'An extremely luminous and active galactic nucleus powered by a supermassive black hole at the center of a galaxy. Quasars emit massive amounts of energy across the electromagnetic spectrum.'
  },
  {
      topic: 'Pulsar',
      description: 'A highly magnetized, rotating neutron star that emits beams of electromagnetic radiation out of its magnetic poles. Pulsars are observed as highly regular pulses of radiation.'
  },
  {
      topic: 'Interstellar Medium',
      description: 'The matter and radiation that exist in the space between the star systems in a galaxy. It consists mostly of hydrogen and helium gas, along with traces of other elements and cosmic dust.'
  },
  {
      topic: 'Cosmic Microwave Background',
      description: 'The electromagnetic radiation left over from the Big Bang. It fills the universe and provides crucial evidence supporting the Big Bang theory of cosmology.'
